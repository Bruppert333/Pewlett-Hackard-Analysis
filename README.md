# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to first sort the data into a new table that shows the people retiring and what their current title is. We did this by using the DISTINCT ON function to make sure the table is only showing their most recent title. We also used the COUNT function to find out how many employees in each department are eligible for retirement. The Last thing we did was join the employees table, department employees table, and the titles table to filter the data showing what employees are eligible to participate in a mentorhsip program. 

## Results
* 72,458 total employees are retiring.
* Of the total employees retiring, only 2 are managers.
* The majority of people retiring are Senior Engineers or Senior Staff. 
* 1,549 employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.
